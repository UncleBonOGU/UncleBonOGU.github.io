Something was born in OGUsers, silent and unmoving. It is everywhere at once, yet nowhere. I do not know it's name, so I will call it the Tao of Grinding. It moves in and out with the holidays as does the tide of the great sea.

Before gamification was the Tao. The Tao gave birth to fora as we know them.

Therefore Posts and Threads are the Yin and Yang of grinding.

Grinders who do not comprehend the Tao always run out of threads and posts, waiting centuries for posts between few threads. Grinders who comprehend the Tao always have more than enough posts and threads to accomplish their goals.

How could it be otherwise?

The Tao gave birth to technology. Technology gave birth to the computer.

The computer gave birth to the forum. There are now millions of fora.

Each forum has a purpose, each expressing the Yin and Yang of grinding.

But do not post in [b]!̷̢̡͘͡@҉̧̛̕͢#̢$̵͡%͜^̶̴&̷̀͞[/b] if you can avoid it.

The wise grinder is told about Tao and dedicates his life to it. The average grinder is told about Tao and grinds. The foolish grinder is told about Tao and lurks.

If not for lurkers, there would be no Tao.

The grinders of old were mysterious. We can not fathom their thoughts, so can only describe their posts.

        Fast, like a cheetah chasing it's pray
        Destructive, like a rabbit digging up a garden
        Chaotic, like a hurricane in the village
        Simple, like a kid's music taste

Posts nowadays are refined. These ancient ways can only be seen through Tao.

A new member from the marketplace went to a grinding thread and then returned to report to his mentor, saying: "What sort of users are grinders? The ones who didn't ignore me spammed my notifications with unsubstantial posts. Their activity contributes nothing to the forum!"

The mentor said: "I should have never sent you to the thread. Those grinders live beyond the physical world. They consider the contents of their posts a secondary thought, just as their lives! They live only for awards, so why should they bother with netiquette?

They are alive within the Tao."

A novice asked the Master: "Here is a grinder that writes spammy posts, and has multiple bans and post count resets. Yet all who know him consider him one of the best grinders in the world. Why is this?"

The Master replied: "That grinder has mastered the Tao, going beyond the need for thought. Posts flow out of him like a waterfall, without caring whether or not anyone sees his posts. Yet, each of his posts are perfect within themselves. He does not become angry when the grinding thread closes, but waits patiently for the next. Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao."

A long time ago, Ace called in two of his advisors for a test. He held up the log of a grinding thread and asked: "What is this?"

The first advisor responded first: "It is a grinding thread."

Ace asked the first advisor: "What action would you take on the thread?"

The first advisor responded: "No action should be taken. It may appear as spam, but the Tao of Grinding is as silent and still as a pool of water. Attempts to moderate it would be in vain, as the Tao lies beyond moderation."

The second advisor was shocked at such thinking: "What are you talking about? The grinders are making ten thousand posts per second, and our servers are literally on fire! Our website is unusable, and we are running out of bandwidth. We need to ban all of the grinders."

Ace wisely had the second advisor hanged.

[i]Thus spake the Master Grinder:[/i] "Small posts are written by small people."

A Master Grinder passed a novice grinder one day.

The Master noted the novice's preoccupation with a book.

"Excuse me," he said, "may I examine it?"

The novice bolted to attention and handed the book to the Master. "I see that the book claims to teach you essential knowledge." said the Master, "Yet what use is this wordly knowledge to a grinder? A true grinder is focused only on his posts."

The novice was curious and asked the Master, "If I only focus on grinding, then how will I pay for my bills?"

"Simple," said the Master. "Sell your credits."

The novice was suddenly enlightened.

A novice grinder approached his Master. "These grinders occasionally post trivial facts on the grinding threads. Why is this?"

The Master said, "Trivial? You do not understand. These seemingly trivial facts are passed down through generations of grinders, ancient knowledge passed down since the creation of the universe.

Mark them, and you will unlock the world's secrets."

Grinders communicate on a different level from the rest of the world, having ascended to a higher level and post count.

First their discourse becomes one with their Grinding, turning communication from an act into part of their Being. Then their thoughts become part of the thread, then their minds, then their bodies. The grinders remain in perfect harmony.

Truly, this is the Tao of Grinding.

        A well-used door needs no oil on its hinges.
        A swift-flowing stream does not grow stagnant.
        A deer blends perfectly into the forest colours.
        Forum threads rot if left unused.

These are great mysteries.

[i]Thus spake the Master Grinder:[/i] "To reject the rules is to reject the forum."

        Does a good farmer neglect a crop he has planted?
        Does a good teacher overlook even the most humble student?
        Does a good father allow a single child to starve?
        Does a good grinder refuse to write a quality post?

A novice told a Master Grinder: "Last night, the grinding thread suddenly stopped for hours. I was desperately thirsting for posts." He asked, "What should I do?"

The Master slapped the novice. "Why do you ask such silly questions? There is no such thing as an inactive thread, only an inactive grinder.", said the Master. "A true grinder takes the shape of his surroundings. To only grind in the grinding threads is pure laziness! Does the site not have hundreds of posts and threads to reply to?"

In the heavens live these figures called "Staff". Every night, they pray upon the members, banning those who LQ post and spam. 

The newbie grinder fears the staff, for he understands not the rules. The average grinder camouflages himself, blending in with the rest of the users and avoiding judgement. The Master Grinder continues to post, unaware that the staff had come and gone.

[hr]

The Master Grinder moves from thread to thread, posting without fear. No change in rules can harm him. He will not be banned, even if grinding is outlawed. Why is this?

He is filled with Tao.
